# What this does
The TV in the JCP main lobby has had little use, so the CS/MS club has decided to make it into something useful.

This display will show CTA transit information in the afternoons and school announcements and events for the rest of the day using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. It is meant to funtion autonomously and automatically, requiring only an internet connection.

Why HTML? Simple: It's the only programming langauge I can do anything in and reasonable understand it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# What still needs to be done
  - Have the information be displayed at appropriate times
  - Fix RSS feeds not displaying
  - Add in system to allow for custom slides or announcements to easily be slotted in and out
  - Build an autoexec script for the slides as the Pi/TV boots up
