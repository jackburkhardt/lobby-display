# What this does
The JCP lobby has a large TV which has had little to no use over previous years. This project aims to use it to display
information about upcoming events, the current day, and CTA transit info. It will be able to run autonomously, requiring
only an internet connection.

An admin control panel is availible to faculty, where information can be changed or modified as needed.

# What still needs to be done
- Everything

# How are you making this?
- Rasperry Pi 3B+ running guysoft's FullPageOS (Buster 0.11.0)
- Python 3.7.4 with Django 2.2.6 LTS
- CTA's tracker API
- Duct tape, tears, and copied code
